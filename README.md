Newcastle University Semester Weeks
===================================

This file produces an ICAL file which describes the week of year and the week
of the semester for Newcastle University. You can use this to help with:

 - working out how many weeks of semester have gone
 - how many remain of semester remain
 - how far through semester 2 Easter occurs

Theoretically, it is also useful for translating between the University
timetables and a normal calendar although in practice, anyone who uses this
ICAL feed probably also subscribes to their own 
[ICAL timetable](https://crypt.ncl.ac.uk/controlpanels/timetable/students/)
which means that they do not need this translation most of the time.

If you simply wish to subscribe to the ICAL feed, I publish a version here:
<http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/phillip.lord/calendar_weeks.ics>. There is no
need to actually use this code to subscribe. The data for this comes from the
[Syllabus Plus / Teaching Weeks Map](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/timetable/services/S+Weeks.php)
released by the University.

It is produced by [Phillip Lord](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/phillip.lord)
and is not formally supported by the University. It is probably of no interest
to anyone not at the University.
